# Learn

## What is This?

This is a project to collect good resources for a bevy of different computer science, computer engineering, mathematics, and physics related topics. These resources are listed below, and organized by topic.

Some resources are kept in this repository itself. The ones that are will be marked `(local)`.

## Resources

### Computer Science

- [Front End Development Field Guide][fieldguide]
- [Machine Structures Cheat Sheet][machinestructures]
- [Data Structures Notes][datastructuresnotes] `(local)`

### Mathematics

- [Probabilty Theory Videos][arbitrarylabs]

### Physics

- [Physics Notes Repository][physicsnotes]
